Saves a small thumbnail of a photograph/graphic image. Allows text to be stored with the Thumbnail to be searched for later. If you have a lot of photographs this might be a quick way to find one. JAI-codec-1.1.3.jar and JTattoo-1.6.11.jar are two frameworks i used to help me create this program. While JTattoo isn't necessary it does make it very pleasing to use.

Here is a link displaying how the program works and runs if you are interested. https://www.freddyhard.com/photopages/links.html
